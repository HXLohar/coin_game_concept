A slot with a main reel area of 6x5 plus an extra reel 6x1.

==== MAIN REEL ====
The following symbols might appear:
BLANK
Nothing happens.
BONUS / SCATTER
Land 2 = They convert into oil barrels.
Land 3 or more = Free Spins
OIL BARREL
As you might guess, this one contains oil.
Regular Barrel: spread 0-2 blocks.
Big Barrel: x2-x4 multiplier, then spread 0-3 blocks.
Mega Barrel: x5-x20 multiplier, then spread 1-4 blocks.
Giga Barrel: x25-x100 multiplier, then spread 2-5 blocks.
Oil cannot spread onto other barrels or scatters.
Multiple barrel spread onto a single block will add +1x that block's multiplier each time.

==== EXTRA REEL ====
The following symbols might appear:
FIRE IN THE HOLE
Detonates all oil blocks on the ground, which will trigger a coin flip feature.
WATER ON THE HILL
All oil blocks below it will have their multiplier halved, rounded down.
Oil blocks without a multiplier will be wiped out.
Oil barrels are unaffected.
RESPIN
All blank symbols on main reel respin.
BONUS / SCATTER (BONUS ONLY)
+2 spins as well as bonus upgrade (if possible)
==== COIN FLIP ====
All oil blocks will reveal one of the following object:
--- COINS ---
$H!T coins: 0.1-0.5
Bronze coins: 1-3
Silver coins: 5-25
Golden coins: 50-2500
Coin value will be multiplied by the oil multiplier.
--- DYNAMITE ---
All affected coins, as well as activated jars, will get their value multiplied.
Possible multipliers: x2, x3, x4, x5, x10, x20
Possible affected area: 33% Vertical, 33% Horizontal, 33% Adjacent, 1% Full Screen.
Dynamite multiplier will be multiplied by the oil multiplier.
--- JAR ---
Upon activation, collect all other coins and activated jars.
Then those blocks will retrigger another coin flip. Jars will remain on the board, as well as multipliers from the oil will be disabled.
Total collected value will be multiplied by the oil multiplier.
==== EXTRA BET ====
Total Cost 15x:
